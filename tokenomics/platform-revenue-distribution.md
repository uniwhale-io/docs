# Revenue Distribution and Emission

### Platform Revenue Distribution

Subject to governance, 100% of the revenue generated on the platform may be distributed to our community. The current distribution percentage is as follows.

<table><thead><tr><th width="512.5"> </th><th>% of Distribution</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Staked ULP (<a href="https://snapshot.org/#/uniwhaleex.eth/proposal/0xc6feb05327d484ee9f6917be3ef77a96d9a234d53c76b88106886d2b2d03a47e">Reinvested</a>)</td><td>50%</td></tr><tr><td>Staked esUNW</td><td>40%</td></tr><tr><td>Reserve Fund</td><td>10%</td></tr></tbody></table>

### Token Emission

All emissions are in esUNW, with a few exceptions including rewards provided to external partners.

#### APR

The formula for the Annualised Percentage Return ("APR") is as follows:

`APR = 7-day average of (APR for block)`

`APR for block = Total payout for block x no. of blocks per year / (total staked value for block in current USD)`

`Total payout for block = (total platform revenue distribution for block in current USD + total emission for block in current USD)`
