# Revenue Distribution and Emission

### Platform Revenue Distribution

Subject to governance, 100% of the revenue generated on the platform may be distributed to our community. The current distribution percentage is as follows.

#### APR

The formula for the Annualised Percentage Return ("APR") is as follows:

`APR = 7-day average of (APR for block)`

`APR for block = Total payout for block x no. of blocks per year / (total staked value for block in current USD)`

`Total payout for block = (total platform revenue distribution for block in current USD + total emission for block in current USD)`
