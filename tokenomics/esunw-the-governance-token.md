#### Token Brief

esUNW is our governance token. Only the holders of esUNW can participate in the governance of Uniwhale. It is a non-tradeable and non-transferrable token, that can be staked to participate in the distribution of the value accrued as well as in the token emission.

Given its nature, its holders are subject to a higher percentage of the value accrued and the token emission, compared to UNW.

The token emission is also in form of esUNW. esUNW holders can convert esUNW into UNW by locking up esUNW over 6 months, over which esUNW will be converted into UNW linearly per block. Locked esUNW (for vesting) may be unlocked anytime.

Locked esUNW also ceases to be subject to any distribution of the value accrued and the token emission.
