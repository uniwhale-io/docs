## How to convert esUNW to UNW?

Once you lock to vest esUNW, you will receive UNW every block linearly for 6 months (you need to claim vested UNW). You can stop vesting and unlock esUNW any time.

For example, Alice has 180 esUNW, and she locks to vest esUNW, then she can receive 1 UNW everyday by each block.&#x20;
