# Early Warning and TimeLock

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (2).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Uniwhale formed a strategic security partnership with [Ancilia, Inc.](https://www.ancilia.ai/), a Web3 cybersecurity company, whereby both sides work closely to protect our assets and community from various known and unknown threats, using Ancilia's SaaS platform that provides web3 early-warning intelligence and preventive solutions to protocols like Uniwhale.

Under the terms of the partnership, Ancilia monitors and provides early warning for any suspicious activities on all transactions on BNB Smart Chain and Arbitrum by any smart contracts owned and operated by Uniwhale.

This will be combined with a TimeLock smart contract which prevents a potential attacker from withdrawing from the protocol.

The combination of the early warning intelligence and the TimeLock smart contract thus protects our community from substantial unauthorized or exploit-driven withdrawals from the protocol.
