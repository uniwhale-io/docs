# Referral Program

#### Introduction

Uniwhale offers a referral program that allows users to earn discounts and rebates by referring new users to the platform.&#x20;

In this guide, we'll explain how the referral program works and how you can generate your referral code to share with others.

Generating a Referral Code: To generate a referral code, follow these steps:

1. Visit [https://app.uniwhale.co/referral](https://app.uniwhale.co/referral)
2. Click on the "MY CODE" tab
3. Generate a referral code using only letters and numbers
4. Note that the referral code is not case-sensitive

#### Sharing Your Referral Code:

Once you've generated your referral code, you can share it with your friends and family. When a user signs up using your referral code, the code will be bound to their account fully on-chain. When the user makes a trade, they'll receive a discount, and you'll earn rebates from their trading fees immediately executed by the smart contract.&#x20;

As the code is bonded, you'll continue to earn rebates even if the user uses multiple devices to execute trades. The discounts and rebates will be distributed as USDT by the smart contract, and your rebate history will be viewable at [https://app.uniwhale.co/referral](https://app.uniwhale.co/referral).

#### Referral Program Tiers

The referral program has a tier system that offers different levels of discounts and rebates to referrers based on the number of active users they refer to the platform. The tiers are as follows:

* Tier 1: 5% discount for traders, 5% rebates to referrer
* Tier 2: 10% discount for traders, 10% rebates to referrer
* Tier 3: 20% discount for traders, 20% rebates to referrer

To create a Tier 1 code, anyone can generate a referral code. To upgrade to Tier 2 or Tier 3, you must meet the following criteria:

* Tier 2: At least 15 active users using your referral codes per week and a combined weekly volume above $2 million
* Tier 3: At least 30 active users using your referral codes per week and a combined weekly volume above $10 million

If your account meets these criteria, please open a ticket with your wallet address and referral code in our Discord channel, so we can follow up.

Rebates and Discounts: Rebates and discounts apply to opening and closing fees for leverage trading on Uniwhale. The opening and closing fees are 0.1% on Uniwhale, and rebates are calculated before user discounts. Referrers earn on the full maker fee and from what would otherwise be spread on other exchanges. As a result, referrers can earn equivalent amounts of rebates per volume on Uniwhale compared to other referral programs. Wallet providers and other cooperative protocols are also eligible for Tier 2 and Tier 3 rewards.

Note that the referral program is subject to change and is governed by the esUNW token holders of Uniwhale.
