# Our Vision

## In Code We Trust

Back to where it started: Satoshi created the vision and practical path of a trustless solution - Bitcoin. Code never lies, and saves us from having to trust a centralised authority. &#x20;

DeFi, as an alternative to CeFi, provides full on-chain transparency and strict limit on use of user funds. With code, credit risk can be made minimal.

## Permisionless, Trustless, Transparency

Not we, but our community decides who has the right to use and benefit from the platform. We believe in the power of full decentralization and permissionless, trustless, transparency.

Uniwhale team is committed to contributing and bringing this vision of the platform to our community, incentivising everyone to participate in the DAO to BUILD together.

## Best User Experience

Unknown slippage, uncontrolled impermanent loss, complicated UX, inflated farming yield - we see many issues in the current DeFi protocols. We are a team of web3 developers / builders, joining the efforts to address these issues.&#x20;

We aim to bring the best trading experience to traders, and the most intuitive liquidity provision to liquidity providers, but without harmful token price volatility. &#x20;
