# Our Vision

### In Code We Trust

Back to where it started: Satoshi created the vision and practical path of a trustless solution - Bitcoin. Code never lies, and saves us from trusting a 3rd centralized party. &#x20;

DeFi, as an alternative approach of CeFi, provides full on-chain transparency and strict limit on use of user funds. With the code, credit risk can be made minimal.

### Permisionless, Trustless, Transparency

We believe we don't decide who has the right to use the platform and how to benefit from the platform, but the community via Governance Vote. We believe in the power of fully decentralization to enable permissionless, trustless and transparency.

The uniwhale developing team will be devoted to contribute and bring the initial vision of platform to our community members and incentivising everyone to participate in the DAO to BUILD together.

### Best User Experience

High slippage, high impermanent loss, complicated UX, inflated farming yield - we spotted many issues still existing in current DeFi protocols and many people are working on solving those. We are a group of developers and web 3 builders, we can't promise we will solve all above, but we are trying to crack one and one more.&#x20;

We aim to bring the best trading experience to traders, and the most straightforward liquidity provision to LPs, to earn marketing making fees like institutions, but without inflated token price fluctuation. &#x20;
