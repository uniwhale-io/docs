Uniwhale is an oracle-based perpetual DEX where you can trade, with up to 200x leverage, BTC, ETH, and many mainstream crypto assets, directly from your wallet.

As a liquidity provider, you can provide liquidity with stablecoins like USDT, USDC, BUSD, and more, to earn real yield from market-making and leverage trading.

Based on objective price oracles and single-sided liquidity, Uniwhale aims to deliver the best trading experience for traders with zero credit risk and minimize impermanent loss for liquidity providers.

* Oracle-based price execution means zero slippage.
* Single-sided stablecoin liquidity means zero impermanent loss.
* Decentralized on-chain trading experience means zero credit risk.

## Uniwhale infrastructure is fully decentralized

* We provide fully decentralized web links. You can run locally if you like.
* Connect through [https://uniwhale.co](https://uniwhale.co) for speed and convenience.
* Use any IPFS gateway to use the service even when the main website is not accessible.
* Mitigate DDOS attacks.
* Unique CID makes our app immutable, mitigating MITM attacks.
* Censor-proof distribution, we will live no matter what.
