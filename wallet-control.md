# Wallet Control

## Keep your assets safe

You have full ownership and control of your assets on our platform. Zero credit risk.

A wallet is an on-chain contract that holds trading funds on your behalf.

When you register, funds are deposited into the wallet, owned and controlled by yourself.&#x20;

Segregation of trading funds at Wallet from the funds in your own wallet is essential to eliminate credit risk between the trade confirmation and settlement time.

You can withdraw the available balance anytime by making an on-chain request.
