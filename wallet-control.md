# Wallet Control

## Keep your assets safe

You have full ownership and control of your assets on uniwhale.io. Zero credit risk.

A wallet is an on-chain contract that holds trading funds on behalf of the users.

When the user registers, funds are deposited into the wallet, owned and controlled by the user herself.&#x20;

Segregation of trading funds at Wallet from the user funds in their own wallet is essential to eliminate credit risk between the trade confirmation and settlement time.

Users can withdraw the available balance anytime by making an on-chain request.
