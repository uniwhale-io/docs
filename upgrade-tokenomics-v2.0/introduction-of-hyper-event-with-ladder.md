# Introduction of “Hyper Event with Ladder”

Currently 65% of esUNW emission goes to Traders as part of “Trade and Earn”. This is effectively a “fee rebate” model, in esUNW, but our observation has been that it has not been very effective in attracting real users.

So instead of indiscriminately giving out the valuable resources, the Proposal calls for much of the UNW emission to be part of so-called “Hyper Event with Ladder”.

Hyper Event with Ladder is any event organized by the protocol to encourage growth, either in terms of trading volume or in TVL. An example is a trading competition, where the best traders are rewarded with UNW.
