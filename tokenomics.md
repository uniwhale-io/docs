# Tokenomics

### Fair Launch and Community Build

A fair launch is a type of crowdfunding in the crypto space, where the project sells tokens to every participant fairly. A fair launch allows for equitable and fair distribution of tokens. The tokens are fully available to everyone for purchase at the same price.

No presale, no VC funding, that means there is no risk of a rug pull event occurring or community being used as exit liquidity. Tokens will be distributed through fair launch for community to participate in and encourage community members continuously contributing and holding.&#x20;

### Platform Revenue Source

Platform revenue mainly consists of transaction fees. All transaction fees are paid in stablecoins, which protects the platform from the mark-to-market risk.

### Platform Revenue Distribution via Governance

Platform revenue will be shared among the platform users, the exact implementation of which is subject to the community vote. This helps the platform maintain deep liquidity and encourages long-term holding.

### veCurve + esGMX = Uniwhale

Our tokenomics builds on how the Curve protocolâ€™s governance vote elected to distribute protocol revenues to CRV token holders and distribute rewards to different stablecoin pair pools to direct liquidity.

We also borrow from the successful escrowed emission model from GMX, where, instead of emissions being a liquid, transferable, governance token, escrowed, non-transferrable, token is used.&#x20;

### Referral and NFTs

Unique ecosystem NFTs will allow any users to participate in liquidation bot and other strategy bot, as well as enjoy fee deduction and more.

By using referral code, traders will receive significant discount on trading fees, in the same time, more transaction volume and revenues benefit the LPs and holders to earn higher yield.&#x20;
