# Tokenomics

### Fair Launch and Community Build

A fair launch is a type of crowdfunding in the crypto space, where the project sells tokens to every participant fairly. A fair launch allows for equitable and fair distribution of tokens. The tokens are fully available to everyone for purchase at the same price.

No presale, no VC funding, that means there is no risk of a rug pull event occurring or community being used as exit liquidity. Tokens will be distributed through fair launch for community to participate in and encourage community members continuously contributing and hodling.&#x20;

### Platform Revenue Source

Platform revenue will mainly be generated from various transaction fees, including open position, close position, funding fees, liquidation fees and etc. All transaction fees will be paid in stablecoins, which reduce the platform from token price mark-to-market risk. &#x20;

### Platform Revenue Distribution via Governance

To maintain deep liquidity and encourage long term hodling, bringing the platform revenue to be shared between LPs and Stakers are essential and shall be decided via governance vote.&#x20;

In addition, which stablecoins can be used as margin on Uniwhale platform will also be decided via governance vote.&#x20;
