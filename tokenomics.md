# Tokenomics

### Fair Launch and Community Build

A fair launch is a type of crowdfunding in the crypto space, where the project sells tokens to every participant fairly. A fair launch allows for equitable and fair distribution of tokens. The tokens are fully available to everyone for purchase at the same price.

No presale, no VC funding, that means there is no risk of a rug pull event occurring or community being used as exit liquidity. Tokens will be distributed through fair launch for community to participate in and encourage community members continuously contributing and hodling.&#x20;

### Platform Revenue Source

Platform revenue will mainly be generated from various transaction fees, including open position, close position, funding fees, liquidation fees and etc. All transaction fees will be paid in stablecoins, which reduce the platform from token price mark-to-market risk. &#x20;

### Platform Revenue Distribution via Governance

To maintain deep liquidity and encourage long term hodling, bringing the platform revenue to be shared between LPs and Stakers are essential and shall be decided via governance vote.&#x20;

In addition, which stablecoins can be used as margin on Uniwhale platform will also be decided via governance vote.&#x20;

### Project Valuation and Peer Comps

We view ourselves as the next generation of DeFi orderbook. Comparing to dydx, GMX, Perpetual's models, we try to solve more (details in medium link). Use June 2022 data (before Arbitrum boost up) makes a more reasonable, comparable model.

&#x20;          Market Cap, FDV

DyDx = 157mio, 1.2bn

Perp = 40mio, 85mio

GMX = 350mio, 576mio

Injective = 116mio, 160mio

Uniwhale = \[20] mio FDV to start with&#x20;

### veCurve + esGMX = Uniwhale

Similar to how the Curve protocol’s governance vote elected to distribute protocol revenues to CRV token holders, and distribute rewards to different stablecoin pair pools to direct liquidity, the team shall propose the similar measure.&#x20;

Inspired from GMX’s tokenomics where escrowed emissions are successfully used. In essence, rather than paying rewards to stakers and liquidity providers in liquid, transferable governance tokens, emissions will be paid in escrowed token forms, to encourage long term holding.&#x20;

### Floor Price Fund (Buyback and burn)

The floor price fund will grow in \[2] ways：

And the floor price fund will be used to 1) and 2)&#x20;

### Referral and NFTs

Unique ecosystem NFTs will allow any users to participate in liquidation bot and other strategy bot, as well as enjoy fee deduction and more.

By using referral code, traders will receive significant discount on trading fees, in the same time, more transaction volume and revenues benefit the LPs and holders to earn higher yield.&#x20;
